    Bath is a world heritage city renowned for its hot springs, Roman history and Georgian architecture. It was the home of the famous mathematician Adelard (his translations of Arabic texts on mathematics introduced the Hindu-Arabic numeral system to Europe). Contestants will be based at the University of Bath for the duration of IMO2024. The university campus is situated on a hill above Bath, providing stunning views of the city and surrounding countryside. <div className="p-3"></div>
    Contestants will be well looked after, with the dining room, recreational areas and the exam hall all within walking distance of the accommodation. Members of the Jury will be located in Bristol where they will set the problems and reside for the initial phase of the competition before joining the contestants at the University of Bath after the <div className="p-3"></div>

    The competition involves teams of contestants sitting long maths exams each containing three problems, on two consecutive days (around 4.5 hours in length). The exam papers are marked over the next few days with each solution (or attempt) being awarded scores. Gold, Silver and Bronze medals are awarded, as well as Honourable Mentions for good effort. <div className="p-3"></div>
    This unique event brings together the brightest young minds from around the world and represents, for them, the culmination of many years of mathematical endeavour and hundreds of attempts at solving problems. Our aim is to provide contestants with a comfortable environment so that they were be able to give of their best in the exams. We also wanted all participants to have opportunities to enjoy the company of like-minded young people from around the world and make memories and friendships that would last a lifetime.

    The competition involves teams of contestants sitting long maths exams each containing three problems, on two consecutive days (around 4.5 hours in length). The exam papers are marked over the next few days with each solution (or attempt) being awarded scores.

    This unique event brings together the brightest young minds from around the world and represents, for them, the culmination of many years of mathematical endeavour and hundreds of attempts at solving problems. Our aim is to provide contestants with a comfortable environment so that they were be able to give of their best in the exams. We also wanted all participants to have opportunities to enjoy the company of like-minded young people from around the world and make memories and friendships that would last a lifetime.

    Contestants will be well looked after, with the dining room, recreational areas and the exam hall all within walking distance of the accommodation. Members of the Jury will be located in Bristol where they will set the problems and reside for the initial phase of the competition before joining the contestants at the University of Bath after the <div className="p-3"></div>
    <h1 className="text-black font-bold">About the competition</h1><div className="p-3"></div>
    The competition involves teams of contestants sitting long maths exams each containing three problems, on two consecutive days (around 4.5 hours in length). The exam papers are marked over the next few days with each solution (or attempt) being awarded scores. Gold, Silver and Bronze medals are awarded, as well as Honourable Mentions for good effort. <div className="p-3"></div>
    This unique event brings together the brightest young minds from around the world and represents, for them, the culmination of many years of mathematical endeavour and hundreds of attempts at solving problems. Our aim is to provide contestants with a comfortable environment so that they were be able to give of their best in the exams. We also wanted all participants to have opportunities to enjoy the company of like-minded young people from around the world and make memories and friendships that would last a lifetime.
